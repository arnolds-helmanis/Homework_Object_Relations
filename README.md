➔ Create a class 'Purchase' with parameters 'clientName', 'itemList'</br>
➔ Create a class 'PurchaseItem' with parameters Product 'product', 'count'</br>
➔ Create several (5-10) 'Product' class objects</br>
➔ Create at least two 'Purchase' objects</br>
➔ Create a method addItem() in the 'Purchase' class that is given a 'Product' object and a count. The method creates a new 'PurchaseItem' object and adds the given 'Purchase' object to the 'itemList' list</br>

  John John bought 25 items for total price of 38.75€:</br>
- 6 bananas for 2.80€</br>

➔ Create and use an additional method removeLastItem() on the purchase that removes the last item from the list</br>
➔ Create and use an additional method removeMostExpensiveItem() for the purchase, which removes the most expensive purchase from the list (not by product price, but by the total price of the given 'PurchaseItem')
